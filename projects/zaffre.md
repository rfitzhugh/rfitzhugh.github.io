# Zaffre

Zaffre Fashion Group is a ficticious customer used to provide real-world examples across all technical Rubrik content. It is used to demonstrate cloud data management, cloud architecture, and infrastructure as code principles.

## Abstract

While Zaffre may be fictitious, it is based on a field-tested design that closely mirrors a real enterprise environment from successful Rubrik customers. Each design decision is backed by business requirements, existing constraints, and the why behind each option selected. We’ve also provided working infrastructure as code samples, when applicable.
