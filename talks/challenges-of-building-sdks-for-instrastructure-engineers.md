# Challenges of Building SDKs for Infrastructure Engineers

An exceptional SDK transcends experience, and is easily usable whether consumed by a first-time coder or an experienced developer. This session will discuss the challenges faced and lessons learned when building and maintaining SDKs for Python and Go.

## Abstract

Building an API-first software platform provides unlimited opportunities for third party integrations. Except that understanding developer documentation for API integration can be daunting for infrastructure engineers who may have only recently created their first Hello, World application! An exceptional SDK transcends experience, and is easily usable whether consumed by a first-time coder or an experienced developer. Providing the option for using SDKs can change the perception of software integration from scary to funâ€¦but that means you have to build and maintain a set of SDKs.

This session will discuss simplicity, reliability testing, error management, and integration considerations. Join Rebecca Fitzhugh to learn more about the challenges faced and lessons learned when building and maintaining an SDK for Python
