# Is it Time to Re-Architect Your Data Center?

Effective processes are the foundation for real change and enterprise-wide adoption of DevOps culture. Specific processes vary by organization but the underlying patterns remain consistent. This session will demonstrate the patterns that are used to build successful processes.

## Abstract

When is the last time your data center was re-architected? Businesses evolve and requirements change; meanwhile, the virtual infrastructure also organically grows and evolves without re-design. It is time to step back and take a holistic view of your infrastructure. This session will guide you through gathering information from key stakeholders and what considerations should be weighed when re-architecting your infrastructure.
