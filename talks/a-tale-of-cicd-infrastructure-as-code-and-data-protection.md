# A Tale of CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, and Data Protection (Sponsored)

I had the pleasure of co-presenting with my colleague, [Bill Gurling](https://twitter.com/vDingus) on some of our favorite topics.

## Abstract

Imagine a world in which backup data may be used to quickly create a development environment at the push of a button. We’ll walk through both CI/CD and infrastructure as code, apply them to your data center, and give live demos using Rubrik’s fully robust set of RESTful APIs. Join Rebecca Fitzhugh and Bill Gurling as they walk through calling RESTful APIs to create workflows that instantiate dev environments on-premises and in the public cloud. We’ll even throw in a bonus example of leveraging orchestration engines to build, test, and validate that your data can truly be restored.
