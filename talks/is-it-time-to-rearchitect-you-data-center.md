## Abstract

When is the last time your infrastructure was re-architected? Businesses evolve and requirements change; meanwhile, the virtual infrastructure also organically grows and evolves without re-design. It is time to step back and take a holistic view of your infrastructure. This session will guide you through gathering information from key stakeholders and what considerations should be weighed when re-architecting your infrastructure.
