# We Should All Be Leaders

Reflecting upon my service in the Marine Corps inspired this session about the leadership lessons I learned.

## Abstract

There are many different leadership styles, but the best leaders demonstrate some common traits. The speaker will present the lessons, the good and her struggles, she learned about leadership in the Marine Corps and how these are applicable to tech leaders. Professional development and continued growth are the only surefire ways to ensure that you don’t get left behind in this crazy tech world. Applying military leadership lessons isn’t about crushing competition; but rather, it’s about leadership based on strategy, confidence in your vision, and integrity, all of which will put you above the competitor every time.
