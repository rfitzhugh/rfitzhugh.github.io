# Learn Version Control with Git and GitHub

This presentation provides a super simple introduction to the concepts of Git and how to use GitHub.

## Abstract

For almost all projects, the source code or documentation is like the crown jewels - a precious asset that must be protected at all costs. Version control helps you manage changes to projects, such as source code and documentation, over time. GitHub is an easy to use version control system that can handle and maintain projects across many collaborators.

This session will discuss the architecture of a version control system, basic Git commands, and GitHub workflows. By the end you will be comfortable with branches, forks, commits, pull requests, merges, and deploying.
