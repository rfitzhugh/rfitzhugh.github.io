# Terraforming Your World

Reproducibility of infrastructure is critical to testing and disaster recovery. We hold these truths to be self-evident...but more often than not it feel it seems like “automation” involves more checklists than code. Learn how this tool can create, change, and even improve Infrastructure as Code.

## Abstract

There are so many options for managing an infrastructure once provisioned, but how do we provision that infrastructure in the first place? Attending this session will introduce you to Terraform, from Hashicorp, your new infrastructure automation engine. Define what you need and let Terraform do the rest. The session is designed to introduce you to Terraform, walk through a first Terraform configuration, and give examples of how the tool could be used.
