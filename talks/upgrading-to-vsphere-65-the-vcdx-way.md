# Upgrading to vSphere 6.5, the VCDX Way

I had the privilege of speaking with my dear friend [Melissa Palmer](https://twitter.com/vmiss33) about the topic of enterprise architecture and how balance all design considerations when upgrading. 

## Abstract

Upgrades can be scary! In this session, two VMware Certified Design Experts will walk you through the design and planning steps necessary to upgrade a VMware vSphere environment. You will learn how to perform a current-state analysis and create a future-state design, both of which are crucial to the upgrade process. Examples of upgrade plans from vSphere 5.5 to 6.5 and from 6.0 to 6.5 will be provided. Learn how to design for and plan an upgrade (with notes and comments) to ensure the availability and smooth operation of your vSphere environment before, during, and after the upgrade process.
