# vSphere Performance Troubleshooting and Root Cause Analysis (Compute)

One section of a two-part session exploring how to use `esxtop` to diagnose vSphere performance issues. 

## Abstract

Is your virtual machine experiencing performance problems? In this two-part session, you will learn about the proper tools to diagnose the problem in real time, whether itâ€™s CPU, RAM, disk, or network resources. You will also find out how to use ESXTOP and the VMware vSphere Web Client to determine whether your issues exist at the virtual guest layer, the VMware ESXi host layer, or the physical resource layer. Part 1 will focus on intrahost compute resources (CPU and RAM).
