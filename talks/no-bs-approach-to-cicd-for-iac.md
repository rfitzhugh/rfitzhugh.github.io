# No-BS Approach to CICD for Infrastructure as Code

I had the pleasure of co-presenting with my colleague, [Chris Wahl](https://twitter.com/ChrisWahl) on how we designed CI/CD to provision and manage our infrastructure across multiple cloud service providers.

## Abstract

This is the story of a small infrastructure team's quest to forever change how infrastructure is provisioned and managed across multiple cloud providers. We walk through all of the steps required to go from a pile of hand-crafted misery to a well-oiled continuous integration machine fueled by Terraform. Learn how we approached code design, workflows, prototyping, bake-offs, team collaboration, remote state, repo design, and more. Demos and sample code will be included!
