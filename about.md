## Hi, I'm Rebecca ðŸ‘‹.

<p>I am a technologist who is passionate about API design, cloud architecture, infrastructure as code, live music, and traveling.</p>

<p>Currently, I am employed as a Sr. Principal PaaS Architect at a team productivity software company. In this role, I am responsible for defining and driving the overall strategic vision and architecture for the company's enterprise cloud platform. Prior to this role, I led Developer Relations (experience, ecosystem, and platform) and was Senior Director of a globally distributed department team of technologists at a cloud data management software company. Additionally, I've consulted for enterprise Fortune 500 customers and government agencies (foreign and domestic) and served in the United States Marine Corps.</p>
