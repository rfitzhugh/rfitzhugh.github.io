description: Tel Aviv, Israel
---

My love affair with Tel Aviv has been constant in my life for over two years since I travel there frequently for work. The city took a little bit of time to grow on me during my first trip, it’s a little bit dirty, and gritty, and has an odd mix of trendy hipsters and traditional Jewish families. But by the end of my first trip, I was in love. The food is incredible, the beaches are pristine, and Israelis are kind and generous hosts for their country. Luckily I’m afforded the opportunity to travel to Israel regularly for work so I’m able to continually explore the city and learn more about the culture. I’d recommend staying either near the beach or near Rothschild Boulevard.

## Things to do //

**Jaffa Port** - one of the world’s oldest ports. The prophet Jonah started his journey that would leave him in the belly of a whale here.

**Bauhaus architecture** - there’s a walking tour that starts every Friday at 10:00 at the Bauhaus Center. (http://bauhaus-center.com/tours.php) Tel Aviv isn’t called the “White City” for no reason, Bauhaus emphasizes simplicity and the white color of the buildings.

**Hit the beach** - personally I like Gordon Beach but Mezizim Beach is also very nice.

**Rothschild Boulevard** - take a stroll down the boulevard, pop into a wine bar or restaurant and enjoy an evening here. Also great for people watching.

**Shenkin Street** - another great place to people watch. Get your shopping on here; also, there’s lots of good places to eat.

**Nachalat Binyamin** - lovely craft fair where you can pick up unique souvenirs from your trip.

## Of note //

I’ve been to Tel Aviv many times, including times when tensions were high and there was much conflict; it’s a safe city. But always keep an eye out for suspicious behavior. Security control checks are a necessary annoyance when entering many places, including markets, bus stations, etc. If requested, just let the guard peek into your bag and end the encounter with a smile. The Israeli military is omnipresent, so it’s not unusual to see young men and women walking around in uniform carrying weapons. Lastly, when flying out of TLV, ensure to get to the airport at least 3 hours in advance of your flight. The airport security is no joke.
