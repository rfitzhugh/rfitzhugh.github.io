# Zaffre

Zaffre Fashion Group is a ficticious company used to provide real-world examples across all technical content. It is used to demonstrate cloud data management, cloud architecture, and infrastructure as code principles.

## Abstract

While Zaffre may be fictitious, it is based on a field-tested design that closely mirrors a real enterprise environment from successful customers. Each design decision is backed by business requirements, existing constraints, and the why behind each option selected. Weâ€™ve also provided working infrastructure as code samples, when applicable.
