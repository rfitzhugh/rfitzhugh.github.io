The Irish are warm, friendly, and outgoing…especially the Dublin cab drivers. They’ll ask you all about where you’re from and proceed to school you on Irish politics and talk extensively about life in Ireland. They’re a wealth of knowledge, take advantage. This post will focus on Dublin but Ireland is gorgeous and I highly recommend getting out of the city and visiting other parts of the island. There are many places in the world I still want to visit, and yet I keep coming back to Ireland. There’s something about its charm that sucks you in and makes you want to stay.

## Things to do //

**Guinness Storehouse** - typical top of the list attraction. Tour the brewery to learn more information about the brewing process and the history of Ireland’s most famous export. Each admission comes with a free pint. I’d suggest doing the ‘pour your own’ option and get a fancy certificate with your name if you pour the perfect pint. Alternatively, you can take the pint at the Gravity Bar, which has great views of the city. Book online to skip the lines and get a discount!

**Trinity College** - take a tour of Ireland’s oldest and most famous college. Tour is given by college students and lasts about thirty minutes.

**Kilmainham Gaol** - famous former prison that has been converted into a museum. This prison once held Ireland’s most notorious prisoners, including Irish Nationalists and Republicans. A great dive into the country’s history for just a few dollars.

**Go on a literary pub crawl** - what do Oscar Wilde, James Joyce, George Bernard Shaw, and WB Yeats have in common? All Irish literally greats. There are numerous literary pub crawls that include a walking tour, discussion of famous literary, and most importantly, booze.

**Dublin Castle** - in the heart of the city, a 13th century castle. It’s not the crazy massive Disney-eque castle of your imagination but it does do an excellent job depicting Ireland’s history.

**Temple Bar** - it’s touristy but it’s a must do on your first trip. Since I’ve been to Dublin multiple times, it’s usually an area I skip…it’s like the French Quarter in New Orleans. But there’s plenty of pubs to pop into for a drink and restaurants for food.
